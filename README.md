# The Void Programming Language 

## What is Void?
Void is a dynamic, stack-based c++ virtual machine and compiler that I started making<br>
for educational purposes. In my free time I always aim towards learning as much as possible,<br>
and once I thought how cool it would be to have my own programming language. Well here it is.

## Why Void?
Void's vision is to provide an easy, understandable programming language for both<br>
educational and production purposes.

## How stable is Void?
According to my testings Void should be pretty stable, but keep in mind that I consider myself<br>
as a c++ beginner, therefore I'm positive most parts of Void could be written in so much easier ways.<br>
If you have encountered any bug smake sure to report them on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/HdgnHqqGAW).

## Can I contribute?

This is a simple example for getting started.
```java
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Console.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

**Compiling the project**<br>
Compile the source code to Void executable.
```
void -compile <project folder> -out <output file>
```

**Executing the program**<br>
Run the compiled Void executable.
```
void -run <void executable> [program arguments]
```
